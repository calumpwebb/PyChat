# Places - Frontend

Places is an ongoing project I'm working on that aims to solve the problem of finding cool places to go, eat and hangout when you're in a new city. I've been fed up for a while with `Top 10 best things todo` and constantly say that there needs to be a better way of choosing what to do and where to be.

*Note: this project is in REALLY early stage development and I'm using a lot of the things I'm building as ways of learning new technology*
