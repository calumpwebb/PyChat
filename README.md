PyChat is going to be an Open Source Terminal Based Messenger system but currently is still in the super early stages of development and architecture decisions.

The current plan is to get an alpha version working and then go back and refactor a lot of the code which I'm unhappy with.

<h3 align="center"> How to Run </h3>
Currently I haven't made it possible for anyone other than myself to run but plan to add a way of running the server using docker-compose and docker files and then making the python client an executable.
